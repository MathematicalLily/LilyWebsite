      <p>Hello, My name is Lily and I am 19 years old and I thoroughly enjoy mathematics and software development! Here you will find my portfolio alongside a mathematics page and also a page showing theorems! I decided tobecome a software developer due to the fact that I am very passionate about technology and furthering my coding skills as well as learning new languages in order to achieve my dream job of becoming a software developer with Deloitte. <br> I am most familiar with Java, Haskall and Python programming languages but have had exposure to html and c# and am very much looking forward to increasing my knowledge of these languages and learning newer syntax for commercial purposes and to help contribute to business wants and needs. Alongside programming, my interests are solving mathematical equations, creating my own theorems and reading proofs and as well as this I also enjoy reading books about technology and computer theory. Spending time with my friends is another hobby I enjoy and I like to go to the gym and exercise with them along with walking our dogs together. I enjoy taking care of animals and helping them as well as helping people, volunteering is something I am very passionate about. In addition to this, travelling and exploring locations is something I very much enjoy- I very much enjoy trying new activities and discovering new locations. <br> I studied at college previously and did 3 A levels of computer science, business studies and a mathematics related EPQ. This enabled me to learn the fundamentals of visual studio programming and I from there, managed to learn more about the java programming language and from then onwards in my spare time, I have familiarised myself with the Java methods, libraries and object orientated principles. </br>  </p>

      <h2>Mathematics and it uses</h2>

      <p>  Mathematics is the study of equations, lemmas and formulae and is very interesting. Mathematics can play a variety of parts in industry such as  in computer science, constructing algorithms. In fact, the pricnipia mathematic was responsible for constructing the first ai working program developed in 1955 and 1956 by newell and Simon. Newell and Simon based their logic of the working artificial intelligence system through the mathematical theorems constructed in the principia mathematica.  </p>
