      <p>Hello, My name is Lily and I am 19 years old and I thoroughly enjoy mathematics and software development! Here you will find my portfolio alongside a mathematics page and also a page showing theorems! I decided to become a software developer due to the fact that I am very passionate about technology and furthering my coding skills as well as learning new languages in order to achieve my dream job of becoming a software developer with Deloitte. <br> I am most familiar with Java, Haskall and Python programming languages but have had exposure to html and c# and am very much looking forward to increasing my knowledge of these languages and learning newer syntax for commercial purposes and to help contribute to business wants and needs. Alongside programming, my interests are solving mathematical equations, creating my own theorems and reading proofs and as well as this I also enjoy reading books about technology and computer theory. Spending time with my friends is another hobby I enjoy and I like to go to the gym and exercise with them along with walking our dogs together. I enjoy taking care of animals and helping them as well as helping people, volunteering is something I am very passionate about. In addition to this, travelling and exploring locations is something I very much enjoy- I very much enjoy trying new activities and discovering new locations. <br> I studied at college previously and did 3 A levels of computer science, business studies and a mathematics related EPQ. This enabled me to learn the fundamentals of visual studio programming and I from there, managed to learn more about the java programming language and from then onwards in my spare time, I have familiarised myself with the Java methods, libraries and object orientated principles. </br>  </p>

      <p>  Mathematics is the study of equations, lemmas and formulae and is very interesting. Mathematics can play a variety of parts in industry such as  in computer science, constructing algorithms. In fact, the pricnipia mathematic was responsible for constructing the first ai working program developed in 1955 and 1956 by newell and Simon. Newell and Simon based their logic of the working artificial intelligence system through the mathematical theorems constructed in the principia mathematica.  </p>

      <h2> Maths  theorems</h2>

      <p>  Below are some mathematical theorems which played a major part in computing.  </p> 
      <p>   This theorem refers to finding the shortest routhe via multiple locations and it is Dijkstra's algorithm. 
        It is used in transportation and packet switching. We  can interpret Dijkstra's as an array of distances 
        from the source nodeto each node in the graph as intialised by specific variables, where the intital distance 
        of s1 = 0 and and for the other nodes the ending distance is set to infinity until we fill them up with
        specific array values. This is done at the beginning because as the algorithm proceeds, the  distance from the source
         to each node in the graph will be recalculated and finalized when the shortest distance to the destination is found. Futhermore,
          Dijkstra's has a big o notation of O (vElogE) so is very efficient for large sets of data and a tractable problem. <br> 
          below shows an example of Dijkstra's algortithm and the finalised solution <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5GT5hYzjNoo/maxresdefault.jpg" alt = "Image" height = "261" width ="632"  >    </p>
     <p>  Nyquists's theorem is also a very useful theorem for sampling sounds when using a digital to analogue conversion system. He states that when sampling sounds you should sample at least twice the highest frequency, in order to enable hearing at full resolution and clearly. Nyquists theorem can be described as (f) = d/2, where d=the smallest object, or highest frequency, you wish to record. Below shows a graphical version of sampling and implementing his theorem. <br> <img src = "http://microscopy.berkeley.edu/courses/dib/sections/02Images/images/sampling.gif"> </br> </p>
     <p>  Another interesting theorem that can be implemented into computing is Cantor's thorem. His theorem is used in sets, which are very important for determining cardinality and grouping data in computer science.Given a one-to-one correspondence between A and a subset of powerset A but not the other way round. The function f:Aâ†’powerset(A) defined by f(a)={a} is one-to-one into powerset(A). Therefore, the cardinality(A) < powerset(A). <br> <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Hasse_diagram_of_powerset_of_3.svg/800px-Hasse_diagram_of_powerset_of_3.svg.png" alt = "Image" height = "400" width ="303"> </br> </p>
